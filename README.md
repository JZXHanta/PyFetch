# PyFetch

Do you really love **neofetch** but its just a little too fast? Maybe you wish it was 8.75 times slower?

Well, your wait is over! I have made a clone using python that is very noticeably **slower** *AND* has **less features**!

## Has only been tested on:
  - Windows 11
  - Ubuntu 22.04 (on WSL)
  - Pop!_OS 22.04

  (If OS is not on above list it will have no ASCII art created for it yet most likely)



## To install (Assuming Python and Pip are lready installed):
  - clone repo ```git clone https://github.com/JZXHanta/PyFetch.git```
  - run command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
  - run command ```python3 main.py``` or ```python main.py```
